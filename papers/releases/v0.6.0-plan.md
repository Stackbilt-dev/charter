# v0.6.0 Release Plan

## Goal

Improve unattended automation reliability and reduce operational friction in CLI output ergonomics.

## Non-Goals

- Major ADF parser redesign
- Breaking CLI command renames

## Prioritized Feedback Inputs

- [ADX-003](../AGENT_DX_FEEDBACK_003.md): install/setup automation friction
- [ADX-005](../AGENT_DX_FEEDBACK_005.md): UX and output ergonomics findings

## Focus Items (Curated)

- Harden install and setup guidance for non-interactive and sandboxed flows
- Reduce noisy JSON payload defaults in migrate-like workflows
- Improve first-run error remediation hints for common platform path and permission failures
- Document recommended command path transition (`npx` bootstrap -> pinned local `pnpm exec`)

## Candidate Tracked Work

Use GitHub milestone items as canonical source. Curated links should be added here only for selected in-scope issues and PRs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Automation path documented with one primary happy-path flow and one fallback flow
- At least one high-friction ADX-005 finding is shipped with clear before/after behavior
- No regression in `doctor --adf-only --ci` and `adf evidence --auto-measure --ci` contracts

## Rollout and Evidence

- Add post-release notes summarizing shipped items and outcomes
- Link merged PRs that implement the selected focus items
- Capture evidence snapshots in README/CHANGELOG where user-facing behavior changes
