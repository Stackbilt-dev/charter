# Organized Commit Skill
1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to inventory all changes
2. EXCLUDE any files with only whitespace/EOL changes
3. Group remaining changes into logical commits by feature/area
4. Present the grouping plan, then commit each group with a conventional commit message
5. Run `git log --oneline -10` to confirm
